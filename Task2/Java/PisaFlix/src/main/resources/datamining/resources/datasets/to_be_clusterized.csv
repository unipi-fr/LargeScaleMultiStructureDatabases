Viswanath) that the temple has to be opened as soon as possible ;  after which he passes away. Karunakara and the villagers are of the opinion that the temple can only be opened by the descendant of Raja Lingeswaran (Rajnikanth) ;  who built the dam as well as the Shiva temple. Lakshmi (Anushka Shetty) ;  the granddaughter of Karunakara and a television journalist ;  goes on a search to find the Raja's descendant. She soon manages to find the descendant ;  whose name is Lingeswaran aka Lingaa (Rajnikanth). Lingaa is the grandson of Raja Lingeswaran ;  but is a petty thief with his family having now fallen on hard times. He holds a grudge against his grandfather ;  feeling that he had brought down his family into poverty by squandering all his wealth and hence refuses to go with Lakshmi to Solaiyur. However ;  Lakshmi implicates Lingaa in a robbery ;  as a result of which the police pursue Lingaa. Lingaa is forced to accept Lakshmi's invitation to avoid getting caught and travels with her to Solaiyur.At Solaiyur ;  Lingaa finds out that the Lingam installed at the Shiva temple is made of Maragatham stone (Emerald) ;  which is extremely valuable ;  so at midnight ;  he enters the Shiva temple with the intention to steal the Lingam. But he is noticed by one of the dam's security guards ;  who immediately alerts all the villagers including Lakshmi ;  Karunakara and Nagabhushan ;  to the temple courtyard. Aware of the villagers' presence ;  Lingaa pretends to perform pooja to the Lingam. This fools the villagers ;  who find it auspicious that the grandson of Raja Lingeswaran is performing pooja to the Shiva Lingam installed at the temple built by the Raja at on the occasion of Maha Shivaratri.

He becomes the collector of Madurai district ;  and arrives at Solaiyur village. There the people tell him that they have no water for 9 months per year ;  and the other 3 months they have heavy rainfall and floods. They are unable to store water and the resulting famines cause hundreds of deaths every year. Though the collector applies to construct a dam ;  his plan is rejected in the annual collectors' meeting and he is forced to approve a new railroad from Tuticorin to Kochi through Madurai for goods. He refuses to do so and is blackmailed that he will be fired. He immediately resigns his job and exits.Later the scene shifts to a palace ;  wherein all the British and Indian guests arrive in the background of a birthday party given by the erstwhile Maharaja of Kodiyur. It is later revealed that ;  the Maharaja is none other than Lingeshwaran (rajinikanth). In the context of hospitality ;  the Maharaja lets slip that he resigned his post of Collector in order to serve the people of his native. When inquired about it ;  he expresses his wish to construct a dam at Solaiyur ;  with his own money and man power ;  claiming all he needed was only a signature in the form of permission from the British Government. The Governor approves it (after a discreet conversation with his lieutenants ;  plotting to gain something out of it) ;  gives permission along with a signed order the next day. Though he faces multiple difficulties ;  the dam is constructed with the help of local man power from the Solaiyur village. It is shown that the Solaiyur village people are very co-operative with Raja Lingeshwaran and work with him cordially ;  except for small feud and near stoppage of work due to a caste remark ignited by Sambandam (R. Sundarrajan) ;  who is later understood to be a spy for the British Collector. Finally ;  the dam is almost completed except for the shaft doors. The doors are being held in custody by the new collector as stolen goods and the floods are soon to occur. Raja Lingeshwaran negotiates with the new collector who proposes that the king gives him all his property (100% of the entire yield) as bribe and all credit of constructing the dam goes to him and British government. The king with whole heart does so. Apart from that ;  he sells his Palace ;  gold and silver and other lands he possesses to gain back the land grabbed by the new collector. Sambandam plays a trick here by bringing the villagers to the palace at the same time when Raja gives away his property documents ;  gold and silver ;  and makes them believe that ;  the Raja is a spy of the British. The dam is fully constructed in 1939 at Solaiyur to solve the water problems of that village. The British lie to the villagers that the Raja was a British spy who would hand over the dam and all the villagers' lands to the British once the dam was completed. However ;  the freedom fighter ;  Kavi barathi (Radha ravi) and another set of few people believe that ;  the raja is really innocent. The irate villagers throw the Raja out of Solaiyur. The Raja boards a train with Sami Pillai ;  and Barathi ;  who joins him apart from his foreboding. Truth comes out in the form of the Collector's wife when she confronts the villagers when they come to meet him for taking back the land which was taken. She reveals that the agreement signed by Raja Lingeshwaran was almost burned by the Collector's assistant and she in time retrieved it and shows them the document ;  there by revealing the true identity of the Collector. Later ;  the villagers realize Sambandam's double play and chase him. unable to face the villagers and due to his own guilt ;  he jumps off the dam wall and drowns in the reservoir. After a long search ;  the villagers find the Raja and his wife Bharathi (Sonakshi Sinha) ;  but living in poverty. After unsuccessfully trying to convince the Raja to return to Solaiyur ;  the villagers decided to keep the Shiva temple which was built along with the dam ;  closed until the Raja or his descendants returned to the village. Lingaa ;  on hearing the Raja's story ;  changes his opinion about his grandfather and decides to mend his ways.Story unfolds again when Lingaa decides to leave the village. He is stopped by the Chief (K. Viswanath) ;  asking to stay behind ;  as he feels something bad is about to happen to the village ;  as it almost happened 70 years back. It is revealed that the honest Dam inspector (Ponvannan) was killed by MP and the new inspector (Jayaprakash) would be inspecting the dam for a name sake ;  thereby drilling holes in the dam ;  to be filled with explosives later by MP's personnel. Finally ;  the same is revealed to the entire village and broadcast to all Government offices the plot by MP ;  which was secretly shot by Lakshmi. After an ensuing fight ;  Lingaa makes the bomb to explode in the water ;  instead on the dam and the movie ends with Lingaa and Lakshmi ;  who are now in love with each other ;  leaving Solaiyur ;  with Lingaa deciding to return once he has done something good in life like his grandfather. . action . thriller .

Hearing noises he turns around to an arrow shot at him and screams.Kerra and Brock are introduced to the story line at their mother's funeral. With their father having apparently disappeared for some unknown reason years ago ;  their mother recently dying ;  and no other known relatives within the area ;  the two are set to become wards of the state. In an effort to keep the two together ;  Kerra decides that they must pack up their belongings and escape before the return of the social worker assigned to their case. Brock ;  having prior association with a local gang and a criminal record ;  assists his sister in stealing the social worker's vehicle.

One night after the siblings arrival ;  an earthquake shakes the area with the epicenter believed to be near the property of their Aunt Corrine and Uncle Drew.Following the quake ;  Kerra is reunited with her imaginary childhood friend Kiddoni ;  who is in reality a noted being from the Book of Mormon. The earthquake is revealed to have caused a rift in time - allowing Kerra contact with the ancient Nephite peoples and their adversaries ;  and allowing Kiddoni and his people to cross the time gap into the modern world.As the story progresses ;  the time portal gap expands and eventually allows the Nephite and Gadianton armies to exit the past near the Whitman's home. Brock on the other hand is unaware of this time rift and eventually finds himself captured by the Gadianton armies. It is at this time that he comes into contact with a scraggly-bearded individual from modern times named Chris.Meanwhile ;  during their escape from California ;  Brock had been given a bag by a former gang-member to take out of the area ;  which is later revealed to be a bag full of illegal drugs. Upon realizing who was in possession of the bag ;  the gang leader decides to make a trip to the small Utah community to recover the bag.Near the end of the story the two worlds clash as the rift in time grows very large. The Gadianton army crosses the time border into the present day in an effort to find food for their armies. Through sheer coincidence Chris and Brock reunite with Kerra near the Whitman home ;  where it is revealed that Chris is the siblings father ;  who had disappeared during a hunting trip many years earlier.

Finding themselves in the otherdimensional world of Etheria ;  Adam and Cringer stop at an inn for lunch and discover Etheria is ruled by an evil intergalactic army known as the Horde. When some Hordesmen soldiers cause trouble in the inn ;  Adam stands up to them and gets into a fight which he wins with the help of an archer named Bow ;  who tells Adam that he and his friend Kowl are members of the 'Great Rebellion'.As word of the fight reaches Hordak ;  leader of the Horde ;  Bow and Kowl take Adam and Cringer to the Rebellion's base in the Whispering Woods. They meet the other Rebels ;  including their leader Princess Glimmer ;  tree people the Twiggetts and Madame Razz ;  the comically inept witch ;  who arrives on her talking Broom to reveal that the Horde are threatening to enslave the villagers unless the Rebels responsible for the fight in the inn give themselves up. Bow is willing to do this ;  but Adam and Glimmer convince the group that they should fight back to save the villagers instead. As the Horde ;  led by Force Captain Adora ;  start taking away the villagers they are attacked by the Rebels ;  aided by Adam and Cringer in their secret identities as He-Man and Battle Cat. He-Man confronts Adora and the Sword of Protection glows in her presence ;  revealing that she is the one he's looking for - unfortunately this distraction allows the Horde to knock He-Man out and capture him. Madame Razz uses divination to discover that the Horde have taken He-Man to their prison complex on Beast Island and the Rebels head there to attempt a rescue. In the prison ;  Adora interrogates He-Man and agrees that the sword seems to be meant for her ;  to which He-Man retorts that he is to give it to someone who serves good rather than evil. As it turns out Adora thinks the Rebels are evil and the Horde the rightful ;  benevolent rulers of Etheria ;  although she admits to not knowing much about life outside the Horde's base. When He-Man dares her to see for herself what life on Etheria is really like ;  Adora says she'll think about it. The Rebels arrive on Beast Island and manage to get into the prison to find He-Man ;  only to get captured and imprisoned themselves. Luckily ;  Kowl manages to elude capture and frees He-Man ;  who then frees the others and destroys the prison. In the meanwhile ;  Adora has ventured into the towns outside the Fright Zone and sees first-hand the cruelties Etheria's citizens are forced to endure at the hands of the Horde.As Hordak and Shadow Weaver discuss how He-Man is too powerful a threat to ignore ;  they are confronted by Adora wielding the Sword of Protection. She has discovered how cruel the Horde truly are ;  but Shadow Weaver enchants Adora into a mystic sleep that will make her forget what she learned and takes the sword ;  planning to learn its secrets. Later ;  Hordak shows the Horde his latest weapon the Magna-Beam ;  a willpower-fueled transporter that will allow him to send the entire Rebel base into exile forever. However ;  none of the Horde's captives have sufficient willpower to fully charge the machine. He-Man sneaks into the Horde base looking for Adora ;  but Adora once again thinks he's the villain and arrests him. Hordak then has He-Man put in the Magna-Beam to charge it overnight. Late that night ;  Adora has nightmares about He-Man's fate and hears a voice calling her name. She discovers the Sorceress talking to her through the Sword of Protection and convinces her to help He-Man ;  whom the Sorceress reveals is not only the good guy but also Adora's twin brother. Instructed to hold aloft the sword and say For the Honour of Grayskull! ;  Adora is transformed into the superpowered She-Ra ;  Princess of Power. After she rescues and revives He-Man ;  the pair destroy the Magna-Beam and make their getaway on Adora's horse Spirit ;  who in She-Ra's presence is transformed into a talking winged unicorn named Swift Wind.She-Ra then reveals that she is He-Man's sister ;  leaving him confused as he's sure he doesn't have a sister. When She-Ra explains that she was told by the 'woman in the sword' ;  He-Man uses the Sword of Protection to contact the Sorceress and she explains everything: When Adam and Adora were born to King Randor and Queen Marlena ;  Eternia was invaded by the Horde. Unable to defeat the combined might of the Eternian army and the magic of Castle Grayskull ;  Hordak plotted to demoralize them by kidnapping the newborn royals ;  aided by his favorite pupil (and He-Man's future archenemy) Skeletor. Although the kidnapping was interrupted by Man-At-Arms ;  Hordak escaped with Adora and ultimately fled through a Time Gate. The Sorceress was unable to discover which dimension Hordak took Adora to ;  so she cast a spell that wiped all memory of Adora from the people of Eternia except for herself ;  Man-At-Arms ;  King Randor and Queen Marlena. Thus Adam was raised unaware of his sister's existence. Convinced by the Sorceress' story ;  He-Man happily accepts She-Ra as his sister. Returning to the Rebel camp as Adam and Adora ;  the Rebellion accept Adora into their ranks after learning that Adora was mind-controlled into serving the Horde. The Rebels have also discovered that Queen Angella ;  rightful ruler of the kingdom of Bright Moon ;  is being held prisoner on nearby Talon Mountain ;  so Adam and Adora volunteer to rescue her. As He-Man and She-Ra ;  they defeat Queen Angella's jailer Hunga the Harpy Queen and reunite her with her people (including her daughter Glimmer).Adam takes Adora back to Eternia to reunite with their parents ;  but Hordak has found out that Adora is with the Rebels and pursues them through the Time Gate. Finding himself back on Eternia ;  Hordak goes to his old base on Snake Mountain and discovers that Skeletor is now the principal villain of Eternia. Skeletor is not pleased to see his old mentor ;  but upon learning that Hordak is after Adora agrees to help him to be rid of him. Magically disguised as cooks and with Hordak hidden inside a giant cake ;  Skeletor and his henchmen manage to infiltrate the royal palace and kidnap Adora. As Man-At-Arms ;  Teela and He-Man reassure the distraught king and queen that they will save Adora ;  Skeletor betrays Hordak and forces him back to Etheria ;  planning to ransom Adora himself. However ;  Adora manages to outwit her captors and ;  reclaiming her sword ;  deals with the villains as She-Ra before running into the rescue party. As He-Man introduces She-Ra to the others and helps her to convince them that Adora is safe ;  Skeletor is left bemoaning A female He-Man! This is the worst day of my life!Adora decides to return to Etheria to aid the Rebellion ;  a decision accepted by her family ;  and the Sorceress sends Adora and Spirit back to Etheria ;  telling them they can use the Sword of Protection to summon aid from Eternia should they ever need it. Adam and Cringer tag along ;  offering to help [Adora] get the Rebellion off to a big start. As He-Man and She-Ra ;  the twins help the Rebels liberate Bright Moon ;  learning more about She-Ra's powers in the process (including using empathy to communicate with the wild animals of the Whispering Woods and healing Swift Wind when he's shot by the Horde).

Herbie passes Trip's car ;  now upside down on the track ;  by climbing onto the catch fence above the wall and riding it all the way to the finish line.

Finally fed up with his life under the GDR regime ;  Peter Strelzyk proposes a daring plan to his friend Gnter Wetzel: they will build a balloon to carry themselves and their families (eight people total) over the border to West Germany. They purchase 1 ; 250 square yards of taffeta (claiming it is for a camping club); Gnter sews the fabric together with a sewing machine in his attic and Peter experiments for months to construct a hot air balloon burner. Of course ;  they face setbacks: fires while trying to inflate the balloon ;  struggles to build a burner with sufficient power ;  extremely suspicious neighbors ;  and doubts about the plan's workability from Gnter's wife ;  Petra.Eventually ;  Peter and Gnter then stop seeing each other ;  to avoid suspicion for when the Strelzyks escape. Peter and his eldest son ;  Frank ;  complete the burner and ;  after extensive testing ;  manage to inflate the balloon. On July 3 ;  1979 ;  the four members of the Strelzyk family attempt to fly out. They successfully take off ;  though they are spotted by the border guard (who do not know what to make of it); however ;  a cloud dampens the balloon and the burner ;  and they crash within the border zone ;  only a few hundred feet from the fences ;  and the balloon floats away. Miraculously ;  they escape the zone ;  return to their car and drive home. Meanwhile ;  the border guard finds the balloon and the Stasi ;  led by Major Koerner (played by Gnter Meisner) ;  begins an investigation to find whoever built it ;  so they can prevent them from trying again. Initially distraught over his failure ;  Peter is convinced by his sons to try again ;  as they did fly and no one was hurt ;  and now the Stasi will stop at nothing to find them. Peter convinces Gnter to help him and both families begin work on a larger balloon to carry them all out. Petra agrees to go with the plan ;  especially since her mother in West Berlin is very sick.Having identified the initial launch area ;  the Stasi begins closing in on Pneck. The Strelzyks and Wetzels purchase smaller quantities of taffeta from various stores to avoid suspicion ;  but they are running out of time. In one scene ;  Peter tries to buy taffeta ;  claiming it is for his group of Young Pioneers; the manager leaves him to notify the Stasi ;  prompting Peter to leave the store. They eventually finish the balloon ;  but have no time to test it. On September 15 ;  1979 ;  the families prepare to move out while the Stasi finds blood pressure medicine belonging to Peter's wife ;  Doris ;  at the place where the first balloon initially landed. They contact the pharmacy and run through all the people whom the medicine is prescribed to ;  eventually coming to Doris. Their neighbor (a member of the Stasi) identifies them as acting suspiciously; the families leave only minutes before the Stasi arrives at their homes. They reach their launch point while the border is placed on emergency alert.The balloon is inflated and the burner is lit. Both families climb into the balloon's basket and cut their ropes. A fire is started in the cloth ;  but it is quickly put out by Gnter and they later see a hole in the balloon and hope it will hold. As they fly over ;  the balloon is spotted and Koerner pursues them in a helicopter. Eventually ;  the burner runs out of propane and they descend; the border guard is mobilized to find them. The balloon lands in a clearing ;  with all eight people unharmed. Peter and Gnter scout to find out where they are. They are found by a police car. Peter asks if they are in the West; puzzled ;  the police officer says Of course you are. Overjoyed ;  Peter and Gnter light their signal flare. The families all then happily embrace each other over the amazing success of their journey." . drama . Delbert Mann . Jane Alexander . Beau Bridges

Madelyn uses Jack Lomax's influence with the President of Venezuela to get herself and Tish to the oilfield where the fire is burning. Madelyn declares This is it for me ;  in the sense that it will either make or break her ability to deal with the fires once and for all ;  fully aware that her relationship with Chance is on the line.The Hellfighters put out the fires with the help of the Venezuelan Army while under attack by rebel P-40 Tomahawk fighters that strafe the oilfield. Madelyn explodes in anger at what she perceives as the Venezuelans' inability to protect the team from the unexpected air raid ;  railing at the Venezuelan army and civil officials for allowing the guerrillas to get close enough to attack. Chance pulls her away during her tirade. She snaps ;  Damned if I understand your attitude! ;  to which he replies ;  It's very simple  you'll do. When Greg asks Tish for her take on it ;  she just smiles and says ;  I think we ought to get her a tin hat ;  referring to the bright red hardhats with The Buckman Company logo worn by the Hellfighters. . action .

"In a British Army glasshouse (military prison) in the Libyan Desert ;  prisoners convicted of service offences such as insubordination ;  being drunk while on duty ;  going AWOL or petty theft etc. are subjected to repetitive drill in the blazing desert heat.The arrival of five new prisoners slowly leads to a clash with the camp authorities. One new NCO guard who has also just arrived employs excessive punishments ;  which include forcing the five newcomers to repeatedly climb a man-made hill in the centre of the camp. When one dies ;  a power struggle erupts between brutal Staff Sergeant Williams (Ian Hendry) ;  humane Staff Sergeant Harris (Ian Bannen) ;  Regimental Sergeant Major Wilson (Harry Andrews) and the camp's Medical Officer (Michael Redgrave) as they struggle to run the camp in conflicting styles.Roberts (Sean Connery) is a former Squadron Sergeant Major from the Royal Tank Regiment ;  convicted of assaulting his commanding officer - which he explains to his fellow inmates was because he was ordered to lead his men in a senseless suicidal attack. Roberts openly scorns Williams's brutality and serves as challenge to his authority. The RSM is a career soldier ;  powerful within the prison in which he is working ;  but realistic ;  No one's going to pin a medal on us. However ;  he sees his duty to be as important as any other - that of breaking down failed soldiers ;  then building them back up again ;  in his words ;  Into men!Staff Sergeant Williams is new to the prison ;  and his ambition is matched only by his cruel treatment of the prisoners; he seeks to use their suffering as means for promotion. When Roberts is accused of cowardice ;  he asks Staff Sergeant Williams ;  And what are you supposed to be - a brave man in a permanent base job? The RSM also questions Staff Sergeant Williams motives for getting out of London ;  as in another scene ;  he slyly mentions the fact that the Germans were bombing the UK (including the civilian prison Williams worked at) just as Williams was volunteering for prison duty in Africa. Staff Sergeant Williams openly admits that he is trying to impress the RSM by showing that he has got what it takes to do the job ;  and attempts to undermine the RSM with a late night drinking contest.Staff Sergeant Harris is the conscience of the prison who sympathises with the men ;  too closely ;  according to the RSM. The officers ;  both the CO (Norman Bird) and the Medical Officer ;  take their duties casually and ;  as Roberts points out ;  everyone is doing time here ;  even the screws (prison officers).In the finale ;  the camp's Medical Officer and Staff Sergeant Harris decide to report the abuses at the camp. Sadistic Staff Sergeant Williams goes to administer one final ;  perhaps fatal ;  beating to Sergeant Major Roberts ;  when two prisoners intervene and appear to attack and very severely beat Williams. Roberts pleads with them to stop ;  knowing that if the prisoners beat up a prison officer ;  then any case they may have had against them is hopelessly lost ;  they are still prisoners ;  and the prison staff have a much stronger hand to inflict whatever cruelty they now wish to." . drama .

"A meditative film dealing with Seon Buddhist views on life ;  Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East? follows the lives of three Buddhist monks: a child ;  an adult ;  and an old man.[5]This film is largely about two Zen koans. The koans are: What is my original face before my mother and father were conceived? ;  and (In death ; ) where does the master of my being go?The film's title ;  although not explained literally in the film ;  is a reference to Bodhidharma ;  a 6th-century Buddhist monk from India who transmitted Zen to China. The question ;  Why has Bodhi-Dharma left for the east ;  is echoed by the young boy's question ;  Why have we all left the world? The entire film can be seen as an answering of that question ;  so that the film itself becomes a koan.The three main protagonists are Haejin ;  an orphan boy ;  Kibong ;  a young monk ;  and Hyegok ;  a Zen master.Haejin injures a bird while bathing. Its mate does not leave the bird ;  but stays around ;  as if to see what becomes of its mate. Heijin takes the injured bird away to heal it ;  but it dies later in the film.The movie then cuts to a scene in which an ox breaks through a confining fence and escapes to the forest. The ox represents Kibong's need to escape ;  as well as his own blind passions. The ox ;  like the young man ;  escapes its confinement but isn't truly free. It seems free ;  but really is still subject to its own desires. The young man also escapes the confinement of the world ;  but is still plagued by his own blind passions. The ox can also be seen as representing the blind passions of the young boy ;  escaping the walls of his humanity and running amok.The abbot instructs a young monk (Kibong) to assist a Zen master living alone in the mountains. The young monk has renounced his life of hardship in search of peace and perfection.The Zen master is a recluse ;  living in a monastery on a high mountain ;  and has come to realise the vanity of knowledge. He also knows the secret of everlasting peace. Dogged by chilblains (inflammation of the hands and feet caused by exposure to cold and moisture) ;  he tries to lead others to the same realisation ;  a realisation which comes only with ardent devotion ;  not simply through knowledge or worship.The old Master mainly tries to communicate his Way through the use of koans - Zen riddles with no absolute answers. The first koan is: What is my original face before my father and mother were conceived? The second koan is ;  When the moon takes over in your heart (that is ;  in enlightenment or in death) ;  where does the master of my being go? He instructs the young monk to hold the koan between his teeth and to solve them. In solving the koans ;  the old Master tells the young monk that he will find an unshakeable peace.The young monk takes leave of the old monk and goes to town ;  where he buys medicine for the old man with alms from begging. He also visits his blind mother ;  who is having a hard time tending to herself. The young monk returns to the monastery ;  disillusioned and appalled at his own selfishness in renouncing his destiny ;  which was to serve his mother and family.He returns to the old monk and communicates his desire to go back to life ;  to embrace the filth of humanity and face the turmoil of day-to-day existence in the swarm of people. He is severely reprimanded by the monk ;  who ;  however ;  does not prevent him. The young monk leaves the monastery to return to his old life ;  but is caught in a flash flood and nearly drowned. He is found sitting on a rock in the middle of rapids by Haejin. The young monk is then rescued by his Master.When the young monk regains consciousness ;  he is informed by the boy that his Master had been in meditation for quite a while and is severely ill. Kibong realizes that the Master has traded his own life to save him. Deeply moved ;  he visits the old Master ;  who extracts a promise from Kibong to perform his last rites as the old man wishes. His wish is for his body to be burned on top of the hill so that he can return to his original place.News of a festivity on the approaching full-moon day reaches Kibong ;  who wishes to attend it with the boy. Hyegok ;  apparently feeling better ;  gives them leave ;  assuring Kibong that he would manage well by himself. The old man also asks them to bring enough kerosene for him.At the festival ;  Kibong and Heijin watch the enthralling dance ;  while it is made known that the dancer is none other than the old monk himself ;  in another form. In his monastery ;  he is slowly making preparations himself. On a bright full-moon night ;  Heijin and Kibong make their way back. On returning to the monastery ;  the boy smells burnt medicine; they quickly discover that the old man is dead.True to his promise ;  with the true meaning and meaninglessness of death ;  possession ;  desire ;  and vanity dawning on him every passing instant ;  Kibong places the dead body in a wooden chest and slowly starts a difficult trek up the hillside. He carries the chest on a firewood pack  presumably the same pack the young monk had used at the beginning of the film to haul firewood to the monastery. The meaning here is ;  in death ;  the body is no different from firewood. This idea was stated earlier by the old man when he told the little boy that the boy's extracted tooth is no different from a pebble in the road.By nightfall ;  the young monk reaches the burial ground. He tries to light the pyre ;  but there is a light drizzle and he can't get it started. He suddenly remembers his master's words about the kerosene. He goes back to the monastery and collects the kerosene. He then returns to the burial ground and sets fire to the coffin. He spends the night by the side of the burning body ;  tortured by his feelings and coming to the full realization of death.Looking around the burning body ;  we see the ox and the young boy. Both seem transfixed by the blaze. Even the blind passions and foolishness of youth are subdued in death.In the morning ;  after the funeral pyre has burned down ;  we see the young monk kneeling and sifting his fingers through the ashes. In this scene ;  the young monk is fully encountering the true realization of death. He seems to be looking for something in the ashes ;  and finds the last few remaining bones of his former master. Presumably ;  these few small bones are the master of the old man's being. They are what is left after everything else is burned away. They are death. The young monk collects these bones and grinds them to powder with a stone. He then walks through the forest ;  scattering the powdered bones over water ;  earth ;  trees ;  and plants.When the young monk scatters the old man's powdered bones ;  he returns the old man to his original place ;  as the old man had said must happen. The old man's original place is everywhere ;  just as his original face is everything. With this realization ;  the young monk finally solves the koans and attains the unshakeable peace the old man had spoken about. He then returns to the monastery. Seeking out Heijin ;  he entrusts the boy with the Master's few remaining possessions. He then takes his leave.In the final sequence ;  we see the boy coming of age. In a play scene ;  the young boy re-enacts the previous night's event by burning the old man's few personal belongings. The boy has done in miniature what the young monk had done the night before. In this act ;  the boy remembers the old man's teachings and comes to understand the nature of impermanence. He wakes up the next day and goes to the stream to collect water. As usual the dead bird's companion chirps to distract him (the chirping bird represents the sound of death) ;  but this time the boy does not even notice it. Understanding impermanence ;  his education is complete. He enters the Master's room and closes it after him. An old Master has died and a new Master makes his beginning. The bird flies away ;  liberated. The wandering ox (which had always been shown before in shadow) returns with a man (possibly Kibong) ;  walking beside him in sunlight. It too has found peace. Rather than having to face the choice between confinement or escape ;  the blind passions now walk alongside the human. Both the human and the passions find their true place." . Bae Yong-gyun .

"Sheriff John Biebe ;  who is married to Donna ;  is one of the townsfolk who play in the Saturday Gamea weekly hockey game played on an open pond. The entire town ;  which is hockey-mad ;  turns out every week to watch. After the game commences ;  we see young Stevie Weeks in the stands ;  kissing Marla Burns ;  daughter of the town's judge. When the judge sees what is going on ;  he raps Stevie on the head and reprimands them both. Donna arrives with the latest edition of Sports Illustrated ;  which features an article on the town and the Saturday Game. The article serves also to explain the nature of the Saturday Game ;  as well as to introduce some of the prominent team members. It also refers to John as being slow in the feet ;  but concludes with a statement that on the ability to skate ;  the Mystery team rivals any team in the National Hockey League (NHL).That evening ;  while having supper with his family Judge Burns and his son Birdie get into an argument about the game ;  with the judge saying that Birdie doesn't play well because he doesn't pass. In an effort to change the subject ;  Mrs Burns mentions that Price World may be interested in moving in to Mystery ;  which would threaten all the local businesses. During the next week ;  John is called into the Mayor's office to be told that he is being dropped from the Saturday game ;  in favour of Stevie Weeks.Skank Marden and the mayor's wife ;  Mary Jane ;  have been having an affair. At the school ;  where he is a teacher ;  he protests to her that she should have told him about John Biebe being dropped from the team. The mayor then enters ;  and Skank expresses his disgust at the decision.John sees Stevie Weeks at the diner and offers him congratulations. John is then called away because Connor Banks ;  the team's best player ;  has just shot someone. While Connor is being read his rights ;  the deputy explains to John what happened. Connor and a rep from Price World named Mr. Walsh got into an argument; Connor fired a shot to frighten him ;  but the bullet ricocheted and hit the rep in the foot. Mr. Walsh is then seen having his foot treated while swearing angrily about Connor and the town. John is then called away as there is helicopter about to land at the town hall. Charles Danner ;  the author of the Sports Illustrated article ;  steps out of the helicopter. In the mayor's office ;  he explains to the Committee that as a result of his article the NHL suggested that the New York Rangers be brought up to Mystery to play the town's team in a televised exhibition game.At a town meeting called to discuss the matter ;  the mayor re-introduces Charlie ;  who although originally from Mystery ;  seems not to have been very popular. Charlie is also revealed to have once been romantically connected with Donna. Initially feelings about the match are mixed but then Birdie indicates his eagerness to play and the game is given a rousing endorsement. Later John is approached by the mayor ;  and assumes that he will be invited back onto the team. However ;  the mayor wants John only to coach: Judge Burns has refused to do so. John says that he doesnt know how to coach.Connor Banks' arraignment is brought before Judge Burns ;  with his attorney ;  Bailey Pruit ;  accepting a trial date for the following week. Connor informs him that he doesn't want a trial so soon in case he loses ;  which would mean he would miss the upcoming game. Bailey tells him not to worry because no jury will lock up the towns star player. At Connors trial ;  Bailey asks the victim ;  Mr. Walsh what he thinks of Mystery ;  and asks him to confirm verbatim transcripts that the sheriff had taken at the time ;  in which he had disparaged the town. The jury delivers a not guilty verdict on Connor Banks. Amid much jubilation ;  Judge Burns angrily addresses those assembled ;  telling them that they have exalted the hockey game above what is right ;  and that they have disgraced themselves and his courtroom. Birdie confronts him in his chambers and tells him he feels that he was always ashamed of his son for staying in town to play hockey ;  instead of going to college.Before the next Saturday game ;  the players watch some NHL hockey on TV ;  and it emerges that the Rangers players are not keen to play the match ;  which they disparage as a joke. In the evening ;  crew from Charlie's TV network arrive. They meet with the mayor and John ;  informing them that they want to call the team the Mystery Eskimos ;  which they both take offence to. While John is arguing with Charlie on the street ;  Judge Burns arrives. John asks him to coach as he doesnt know how to ;  but the Judge turns him down.Preparations for the match continue ;  with it becoming obvious that it is now becoming much more than a game of pond hockey. The mayor and his wife Mary Jane are discussing the forthcoming game ;  when he finds a locket which he realizes is Skank's. He confronts Mary Jane ;  and says ;  Skank Marden has been in this bed. They fight ;  but some days later they reconcile.When the mayor meets Charlie the next morning ;  Charlie tells him that the Rangers players had filed a grievance with their players' union ;  and are no longer coming. The mayor punches Charlie ;  giving him a bloody nose. Judge Burns meets Bailey and tells him that there is a hearing in New York over the legal dispute. He suggests to him that it might be useful for Mystery to have a presence ;  and suggests a few legal arguments he could use.At the hearing Bailey makes an impassioned plea for the game to continue. However ;  while still arguing the case he suffers a fatal heart attack. After the funeral back in Mystery ;  it is revealed that he won the case ;  and the game is back on. John confronts the judge ;  saying that as he sent Bailey to New York he would now have to take over the coaching. The judge agrees ;  but only if John will come back onto the team as captain.Under the guidance of the judge ;  the team is seen training frantically for the match.The Rangers' players arrive by helicopter and are greeted by the mayor and townsfolk ;  who are all amazed at their size. John is called away to deal with a problem ;  which is revealed to be Charlie driving drunkenly on a Zamboni. He and John talk ;  and he reveals his bitterness towards Mystery ;  which he believes rejected him. John points out to him that bringing the Rangers to Mystery could destroy the town if its team were to lose very badly.During the match ;  the Mystery team take time to settle ;  but eventually go ahead two goals to nothing in the first period. One of the goals is scored by Stevie ;  who impresses the commentators with his speed. In the second period however ;  the Rangers score five unanswered goals. Birdie costs the team a goal through his desire to go it alone when he should have passed. Unwilling to accept defeat ;  Mystery scores two goals in the third period ;  including one from a pass that Birdie makes instead of shooting for goal himself. As the clock ticks down ;  Connor has a chance to level the scores ;  but his shot hits the crossbar ;  and the game is over ;  with the score at 5  4 to the Rangers. Both the Mystery team and spectators appear completely deflated ;  until Judge Burns starts clapping for them ;  after which even the Rangers players applaud them.The following day the Rangers leave ;  and it is revealed that both Stevie Weeks and Connor Banks have been given professional contracts and fly out with the Rangers." . comedy . sports .

As Bumpy is leaving ;  he sees Bub Hewlett and asks if he had a hand in Illinois's murder. He denies any involvement so Bumpy spares him and tells him that he now owes him.Bumpy has a meeting with Bub and tells him that it's not in his best interest to continue working for Dutch.

Lulu walks outside ;  gets in Luciano's car and asks to be paid but instead ;  an associate of Luciano's shoots him dead and dumps his body on the sidewalk.The last scene shows Bumpy asking Bub if those involved have been paid ;  with Bub saying yes. With the Queen back in business ;  Johnson tells Bub that he has some unfinished business and Bub says he's going to go get some sleep. The two shake hands and part company.

When he arrives at the coffin ;  he goes down on his knees with tears in his eyes ;  then turns and walks out.

"Other revelations in the film include: the discovery that many ratings board members either have children 18 and over or have no children at all (typically ;  the MPAA has suggested it hires only parents with children between the ages of 5 and 17); that the board seems to treat homosexual material much more harshly than heterosexual material (this assertion is supported by an MPAA spokespersons statement in USA Today that We don't create standards; we just follow them); that the board's raters receive no training and are deliberately chosen because of their lack of expertise in media literacy or child development; that senior raters have direct contact in the form of mandatory meetings with studio personnel after movie screenings; and that the MPAA's appeals board is just as secretive as the ratings board ;  its members being mostly movie theater chain and studio executives. Also included on the appeals board are two members of the clergy (one Catholic and one Protestant ;  who may or may not have voting power).Prior to Sundance ;  the film sparked initial press interest when it was handed an NC-17 rating by the MPAA for some graphic sexual content. When it premiered at Sundance ;  the film's ratings deliberations ;  along with Dicks appeal ;  were included in the documentary. Since the film had changed dramatically from the time of the NC-17 rating ;  the film cannot be released with an MPAA rating without the film being resubmitted for review.The film went on to draw crowds at many other festivals ;  including South by Southwest and the Seattle International Film Festival ;  and was slated for theatrical release in fall 2006." . documentary .
